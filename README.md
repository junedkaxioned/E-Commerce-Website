prdxn-dev-framework
===================

PRDXN's "starting package" used for development.


Note:

1) Icon used in Template was'nt provided in assets  and I am unable to find exactly the same so I used similar ones from font awesome.
2) Unable to get the same Font type  so I downloaded the similar type of font in ttf format and used in the css.
3) Total accessories Images not provided in assets hence, used the same image and changed the order.
4)  why Choose section image was'nt provided in assets hence, I used the placeholder of  same size.
